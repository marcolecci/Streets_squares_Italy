# Streets_squares_Italy
This repository contains the data and code used to retrieve and extract all the streets and squares in Italy using the OSMnx package from Python. The OSMnx package allows for easy access to street and other network data from OpenStreetMap, and this project leverages this to create a comprehensive dataset of Italian streets and squares.
